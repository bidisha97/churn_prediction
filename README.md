# churn_prediction
A Bank wants to take care of customer retention for its product: savings accounts.
The bank wants  to identify customers likely to churn balances below the minimum balance.
We have the customers information such as age, gender, demographics along with their transactions with the bank.
This is a binary classification problem whether the customer retains or not so we have to put more importance with the Recall and AUC-ROC from the individual matrices.
Out of the three models that we have built random forest scores better with 83%.
